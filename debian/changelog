  * gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
    Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
    which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
  * Fix compiler error with SetHFOV
    In gazebo7, the rendering::Camera::SetHFOV function
    is overloaded with a potential for ambiguity,
    as reported in the following issue:
    https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1830
    This fixes the build by explicitly defining the

  * Fix gazebo7 build errors
    The SensorPtr types have changed from boost:: pointers
    to std:: pointers,
    which requires boost::dynamic_pointer_cast to change to
    std::dynamic_pointer_cast.
    A helper macro is added that adds a using statement

  * update test world for block laser
  * this corrects the right orientation of the laser scan and improves on comparison between 2 double numbers
  * Initialize ``depth_image_connect_count_`` in openni_kinect plugin
  * multicamera bad namespace. Fixes #161 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/161>
    There was a race condition between GazeboRosCameraUtils::LoadThread
    creating the ros::NodeHandle and GazeboRosCameraUtils::Load
    suffixing the camera name in the namespace

ros-melodic-gazebo-plugins (2.3.4-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * rerelease because sdformat became libsdformat, but we also based change on 2.3.4 in hydro-devel.
  * Simplify ``gazebo_plugins/CMakeLists.txt``
    Replace ``cxx_flags`` and ``ld_flags`` variables with simpler cmake macros
    and eliminate unnecessary references to ``SDFormat_LIBRARIES``, since
    they are already part of ``GAZEBO_LIBRARIES``.
  * Put some cmake lists on multiple lines to improve readability.
  * Add dependencies on dynamic reconfigure files
    Occasionally the build can fail due to some targets having an
    undeclared dependency on automatically generated dynamic
    reconfigure files (GazeboRosCameraConfig.h for example). This
    commit declares several of those dependencies.

  * gazebo_plugins: use shared pointers for variables shared among cameras
    It is not allowed to construct a shared_ptr from a pointer to a member
    variable.
  * gazebo_plugins: moved initialization of shared_ptr members of
    GazeboRosCameraUtils to GazeboRosCameraUtils::Load()
    This fixes segfaults in gazebo_ros_depth_camera and
    gazebo_ros_openni_kinect as the pointers have not been initialized
    there.
  * Use RenderingIFace.hh

  * Make gazebo includes use full path

    full path for include files. For example,
    include <physics/physics.hh> will not be valid
    include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh> must be done instead.
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of gazebo_ros_pkgs <github.com:ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs> into synchronize_with_drcsim_plugins
  * change includes to use brackets in headers for export
  * per pull request comments
  * Changed resolution for searchParam.
